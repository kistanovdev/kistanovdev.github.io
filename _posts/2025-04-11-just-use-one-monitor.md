Admit it, you are not this guy. 99.99% of people who use a computer are not this guy.
This guy shouldn't be this guy. One monitor is enough.


### Windows, macOS and Linux

Tiling software has gotten extremely good on all platforms. Windows has been on top of their game
since the release of Windows 10. macOS is still catching up, but there are software solutions that close the gaps. 
For Linux, once people figure
out what driver to use to make their monitor work, they become skilled enough to figure out the tiling software.

### Tabs
Figure out how to tab between windows and never go full screen. Once you get used to it, your speed of working
on a computer will be unmatched.

### Head movement
Keeping your head in one place and just letting your eyes move around the screen will prevent strain and fatigue on 
your neck.

### Wireless mouse and keyboards.
Adding these items to the mix will help with overall experience.
