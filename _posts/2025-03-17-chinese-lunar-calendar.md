summary: "二月 vs 农历二月"
---

Since Chinese also have to live in the modern world, they use both lunar and Gregorian
calendar. However, for Gregorian one, they use character 月 (lit. moon) with a number in the front.
When they want to talk about Lunar months, they just attach 农历 (lunar calendar) to it.
